## uTerm

uTerm (micro-Term) is a VT100-like terminal for the Z80-MBC2 (https://hackaday.io/project/159973). It has a VGA out and PS/2 keyboard connector, a power supply for the Z80-MBC2 and a "transparent" serial-USB port.

These are the sources modified for the uTerm forked from the Madis Kaal 
repository (forked from the original repository of K. C. Lee: 
https://github.com/FPGA-Computer/STM32F030F4-VGA. Original project 
page: https://hw-by-design.blogspot.com/2018/07/low-cost-vga-terminal-module-project.html)
